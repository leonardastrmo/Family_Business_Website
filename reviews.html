    <h2 style="font-family: GeneralSansMedium; text-align: left; font-size: 1.7rem; margin-bottom: 20px;">What do our guests say about us?</h2>

      <div class="review">
        <p>"We traveled with our entire family consisting of 6 adults and 3 children under 6 years old in mid-April. Goran met
            us in the heart of the nearby village and took us to the villa.</br> (Arrival by taxi from the airport in less than 20 minutes.)
            Goran showed us the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">entire property with a very personal approach and history</span>. The photos do not show how great the accommodation is
            and what quality the location has! It is, in our opinion, a place that surprises with its charm, variety of facilities and location.
            Over the years we have rented many accommodations and rarely have we found something that matches this accommodation.
            <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">Short travel time to and from the airport</span>, which in itself is a very positive experience with little stress! The surroundings 
            of the island with diverse terrain and experiences. Short distance to everything, and you can reach Torgir on foot with many good restaurants.
            Mid-April is the beginning of the season and most of the local bars and restaurants were closed. BUT, with Goran's unique outdoor kitchen and barbecue,
            it is a real pleasure to cook for yourself! Many thanks!"</p>

          <p>"Absolutely incredible from start to finish. Goran and his wife were so gracious and accommodating.
            We were arriving late in the evening and Goran helped us out by picking up a few grocery items for breakfast.
            He met and <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">escorted us to the property</span> which was tremendously helpful as the streets are narrow and winding and place may
            have been tough to find in the dark. The place is <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">absolutely incredible- exactly as described and depicted in the photos</span>.
            There were so many little areas to sit and relax outside on the bedrooms each having a bathroom was so nice for a group.
            Despite a little rainy weather in March, we were able to enjoy the outdoor kitchen and <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">outdoor fire for bbq, as well as the hot tub.</span>
            It was a dream vacation and a dream home. The <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">views of the sea</span> were so amazing to wake up to each morning. Grocery store
            and restaurants were accessible on the island. We are so grateful for this wonderful and relaxing stay!"</p>

            <p>"Beautiful location, very accommodating host, and the house makes you feel right at home. We visited during the off-season so the roads and nearby </br>
                amenities were not too busy. The entrance and exit to the property are a bit steep, but it is easier to navigate with smaller cars. Goran
                was wonderful, respectful, and accommodating. Our group of seven would definitely return."</p>

      <p>"Villa Strmo is <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">a very special place</span> and we felt incredibly relaxed all ten days.</br>
        We were there with nine adults and a small child (4) and enjoyed every minute.</br>
        The house is furnished with everything you need and is <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">right on the sea.</span> The </br>
        rooms are modern, all have their own bathrooms and the beds and blankets</br>
        are great. There are two kitchens and the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">outdoor kitchen</span> is a dream. The </br>
        garden, the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">chill areas</span> and the jacuzzi are also great and everyone has found </br>
        their place. We found and used many leisure activities for sea and garden.</br>
        Thanks for the easel and the various painting utensils! <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">Altogether successful</span> </br>
        and if we come back into the corner then its with Goran."</p>

      <p>"An absolute dream villa! We hardly left the villa as it <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">really offers everything</span> your</br>
        heart desires! The outdoor kitchen in particular is really fantastic. The whirlpool </br>
        even has a music function! Goran and Viktor are super personable and were</br>
        always available and available with advice and action. As a surprise there was a </br>
        stand-up paddle for the new season! Although we already had high expectations</br>
        based on the pictures, these <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">expectations were exceeded</span> on site."</p>

        <p>"Best week ever! This house is <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">absolutely amazing</span>. We had a really great time as</br>
            a family. The location is very beautiful und the  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">communication was very easy.</span></br>
            We would definitely come again!"</p>

        <p>"Dream house by the sea!</br>
            We were welcomed very warmly by Viktor, owners son, who invited us to Villa Strmo.</br>
            Only a few kilometers from Trogir, you can reach this beautiful, <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">completely newly</span> </br>
            <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">renovated</span> Villa via a narrow steep road. Viktor took a lot of time and showed us </br>
            everything in and around the house. For example, the service from the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">great jacuzzi</span></br>
            which we enjoyed every day.</br>
            The villa actually exceeded our expectations! The photos in advance were really nice, </br>
            but this view from the garden to the sea was overwhelming. Garden door up </br>
            and into the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">crystal clear sea.</span> I A metal guide makes it very easy to get into the water.</br>
            Only a few meters away you can reach a beach, which is very suitable for small </br>
            children.</br>
            Villa has 5 very <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">beautiful rooms each with its own bathroom.</span> The house is very</br>
            lovingly furnished and has a special flair with a feel good factor. In the garden there is </br>
            the outdoor kitchen, equipped with everything you can imagine (induction cooker, </br>
            oven, dishwasher, large refrigerators, dishes, glasses...). The <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">large garden</span> has many</br>
            different places where you can sit together, but also be undisturbed. Sun beds,</br>
            porch swing, different lovely lounges. We all <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">felt completely comfortable</span> this week </br>
            and will definitely be back.</br>
            Again, our warmest thanks to Viktor, Goran and Lea for the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">very warm hospitality</span>.</br>
            We look forward to a reunion."</p>

        <p>" The apartment is great, we have <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">really enjoyed our stay here.</span> Everything was as</br>
            expected and as shown on the ad. Victor and Lea were very helpful and</br>
            welcoming, gave us good tips and hints. <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">Couldn't ask for more!</span> We will</br>
            <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">definitely recommend</span> this place to our friends!"</p>

        <p>"Goran's home was <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">even better than the pictures.</span> The check in was easy and the</br>
            home was walking distance to the beach, downtown, and the stadium. Goran even</br>
            allowed us a late check out the following day since our plane didn't leave until the</br>
            afternoon. Thanks so much for <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">a great stay!</span>"</p>

        <p>"Wow! What an incredible house with a fantastic location. Very thankful to.</br>
          find this house for our stay! Viktor and his father were great hosts. The </br>
          contact prior to <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">our stay was informative and helpful</span>, Viktor answered any</br>
          questions we had. On the day of arrival we were met a short drive away </br>
          from the house then followed Lea, Viktor and their father to the house (the roads</br>
          are narrow and steep hills at times). At the house Lea and Viktor gave us a tour. We </br>
          then sat in the garden all together and Viktor offered us a  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">welcome drink</span></br>
          and gave us some house and local tips/information. Throughout our stay</br>
          the hosts were contactable and  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">very quick to reply</span> when we had any </br>
          questions. A lovely, memorable stay for our group (6 adults, 2 children and</br>
          a baby) and we  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">hope to visit again.</span> With sincere thanks!"</p>
