    Villa Strmo is <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">a very special place</span> and we felt incredibly relaxed all ten days.</br>
    We were there with nine adults and a small child (4) and enjoyed every minute.</br>
    The house is furnished with everything you need and is <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">right on the sea.</span> The </br>
    rooms are modern, all have their own bathrooms and the beds and blankets</br>
    are great. There are two kitchens and the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">outdoor kitchen</span> is a dream. The </br>
    garden, the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">chill areas</span>c and the jacuzzi are also great and everyone has found </br>
    their place. We found and used many leisure activities for sea and garden.</br>
    Thanks for the easel and the various painting utensils! <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">Altogether successful</span> </br>
    and if we come back into the corner then its with Goran.</br>

    An absolute dream villa! We hardly left the villa as it <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">really offers everything</span> your</br>
    heart desires! The outdoor kitchen in particular is really fantastic. The whirlpool </br>
    even has a music function! Goran and Viktor are super personable and were</br>
    always available and available with advice and action. As a surprise there was a </br>
    stand-up paddle for the new season! Although we already had high expectations</br>
    based on the pictures, these <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">expectations were exceeded</span> on site.</br>

    Wow! What an incredible house with a fantastic location. Very thankful to.</br>
    find this house for our stay! Viktor and his father were great hosts. The </br>
    contact prior to <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">our stay was informative and helpful</span>, Viktor answered any</br>
    questions we had. On the day of arrival we were met a short drive away </br>
    from the house then followed Viktor and his father to the house (the roads</br>
    are narrow and steep hills at times). At the house Viktor gave us a tour. We </br>
    then sat in the garden all together and Viktor offered us a  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">welcome drink</span></br>
    and gave us some house and local tips/information. Throughout our stay</br>
    Viktor was contactable and  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">very quick to reply</span> when we had any </br>
    questions. A lovely, memorable stay for our group (6 adults, 2 children and</br>
    a baby) and we  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">hope to visit again.</span> With sincere thanks!</br>

    Dream house by the sea!</br>
    We were welcomed very warmly by Viktor, owners son, who invited us to Villa Strmo.</br>
    Only a few kilometers from Trogir, you can reach this beautiful, <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">completely newly</span> </br>
    <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">renovated</span> Villa via a narrow steep road. Viktor took a lot of time and showed us </br>
    everything in and around the house. For example, the service from the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">great jacuzzi</span></br>
    which we enjoyed every day.</br>
    The villa actually exceeded our expectations! The photos in advance were really nice, </br>
    but this view from the garden to the sea was overwhelming. Garden door up </br>
    and into the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">crystal clear sea.</span> I A metal guide makes it very easy to get into the water.</br>
    Only a few meters away you can reach a beach, which is very suitable for small </br>
    children.</br>
    Villa has 5 very <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">beautiful rooms each with its own bathroom.</span> The house is very</br>
    lovingly furnished and has a special flair with a feel good factor. In the garden there is </br>
    the outdoor kitchen, equipped with everything you can imagine (induction cooker, </br>
    oven, dishwasher, large refrigerators, dishes, glasses...). The <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">large garden</span> has many</br>
    different places where you can sit together, but also be undisturbed. Sun beds,</br>
    porch swing, different lovely lounges. We all <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">felt completely comfortable</span> this week </br>
    and will definitely be back.</br>
    Again, our warmest thanks to Viktor, Goran and Lea for the <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">very warm hospitality</span>.</br>
    We look forward to a reunion.</br>

    Best week ever! This house is <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">absolutely amazing</span>. We had a really great time as</br>
    a family. The location is very beautiful und the  <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">communication was very easy.</span></br>
    We would definitely come again!</br>

    The apartment is great, we have <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">really enjoyed our stay here.</span> Everything was as</br>
    expected and as shown on the ad. Victor and Lea were very helpful and</br>
    welcoming, gave us good tips and hints. <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">Couldn't ask for more!</span> We will</br>
    <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">definitely recommend</span> this place to our friends!

    Goran's home was <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">even better than the pictures.</span> The check in was easy and the</br>
    home was walking distance to the beach, downtown, and the stadium. Goran even</br>
    allowed us a late check out the following day since our plane didn't leave until the</br>
    afternoon. Thanks so much for <span style="font-family:GeneralSansMediumItalic">a great stay!</span></br>
